            Food production is a critical and dynamic aspect of the global ecosystem, 
            affecting not only our physical health, but also our economy, culture and environment. 
            In a changing world, the world food production continues to evolve due to factors 
            such as increasing population and people's growing demand for nutrition.

            <br>
            From 1961 to 2013, 
            this dynamic visual map provides a concise overview of the changing patterns of global food production. 
            By choosing different years, changes and trends in agricultural output over time can be observed.
            The legend on the right displays food production using color saturation.

            The global population is projected to increase to 9.7 billion by the year 2050. 
            Addressing the challenge of feeding this expanding population has emerged as a prominent issue for food and agricultural entities, 
            as well as entrepreneurs and philanthropic organizations. Potential solutions encompass a broad spectrum, 
            including transforming agricultural practices and revolutionizing dietary habits. 
            This is also the main purpose of the visualization, to explore changes in the yield of food types
            <br>
            The visualization above employs a stacked bar chart to display the category rankings of various foods 
            from 2000 to 2013. Users can select the food types they are interested in, 
            or concerned about using the provided options. 
            They can view specific data for a chosen category during a particular time period 
            and subsequently analyze trends or forecast. Additionally, 
            the legend is positioned on the right side to prevent the use of both red and green.

            Food production not only varies over time 
            but also differs based on the type of food, 
            and the rates of change also vary. 
            This area chart displays the production of major food items 
            in various countries around the world from 2000 to 2013.
            <br>
            
            
            I added the "point" interaction feature. By clicking on the different food categories listed in the legend on the right side, 
            the corresponding area will be retained, 
            while the opacity of the other areas will decrease.

            Feed production is an important economic and agricultural indicator, 
            which not only reflects the scale and efficiency of agricultural production,

            agricultural economy and markets.
